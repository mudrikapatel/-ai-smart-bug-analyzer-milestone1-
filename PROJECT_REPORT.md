# Creation of Intelligent Bug Diagnosis Platform with Fix Recommendation Assistance

## Group 1

# 1. Introduction

Software development teams receive a large number of bug reports during the software development and maintenance lifecycle. These reports may contain error messages, stack traces, application logs, screenshots, descriptions of unexpected behavior, reproduction steps, and information about the affected software component. In many real-world situations, bug reports are incomplete or written in different formats, making manual analysis difficult.

When a new bug is reported, developers generally need to perform several activities before they can start implementing a fix. They need to understand the severity of the issue, identify the affected component, inspect error messages and stack traces, determine where the failure occurred, search for similar historical bugs, identify the probable root cause, and determine whether the issue has already been reported.

This process can consume significant engineering time, particularly in large projects where thousands of historical bug reports are available.

The proposed **Intelligent Bug Diagnosis Platform with Fix Recommendation Assistance** addresses this problem by combining Artificial Intelligence, multi-agent architecture, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic similarity search, and historical defect knowledge.

The platform is designed to analyze a submitted bug automatically and provide structured diagnostic information to developers.

The system uses multiple specialized AI agents. Each agent is responsible for a particular stage of bug diagnosis. The Triage Agent analyzes severity, priority, and affected components. The Log Analysis Agent examines stack traces, error messages, and logs. The Root Cause Agent uses the collected information to identify the probable cause of the failure. The Duplicate Detection Agent searches historical defects for similar issues. Finally, the Remediation Agent uses the analysis and historical resolutions to recommend possible fixes.

The system also includes a historical defect knowledge base built using public defect datasets. Semantic embeddings are generated for historical bug information and stored in a vector database. When a new bug is submitted, the system retrieves relevant historical bugs and uses them as additional context for diagnosis and recommendation.

The project was developed progressively through four milestones:

* **Milestone 1:** Research, architecture design, bug submission module, and historical defect knowledge base.
* **Milestone 2:** Triage Agent, Log Analysis Agent, and multi-agent orchestration.
* **Milestone 3:** Root Cause Agent, Duplicate Detection Agent, Remediation Agent, and structured findings.
* **Milestone 4:** Defect pattern analytics, knowledge base growth, systemic issue detection, and end-to-end testing.

The final system therefore provides an end-to-end intelligent bug diagnosis workflow rather than a single AI-based prediction.

---

# 2. Objectives

The main objective of the project is to develop an intelligent platform that can assist software developers in diagnosing software defects and finding possible solutions using AI and historical defect knowledge.

The specific objectives are:

* Automatically analyze newly submitted bug reports.
* Classify bug severity.
* Assign bug priority.
* Identify the affected software component.
* Provide confidence scores for classification results.
* Analyze application logs.
* Analyze stack traces.
* Identify exception types.
* Identify failure points.
* Identify affected code paths.
* Retrieve similar historical bug reports.
* Identify probable root causes.
* Detect potentially duplicate bug reports.
* Retrieve previous resolutions for similar defects.
* Recommend possible fixes.
* Display diagnostic information in a structured format.
* Maintain a growing historical defect knowledge base.
* Identify recurring defect patterns.
* Identify components that repeatedly produce defects.
* Identify recurring root causes.
* Detect possible systemic software issues.
* Validate the complete system using different categories of software errors.
* Reduce repetitive manual debugging effort.
* Improve the reuse of previously acquired software engineering knowledge.

---

# 3. Overall System Design

The complete platform consists of multiple modules that work together to provide end-to-end bug diagnosis.

The major modules used for the project are:

1. Bug Submission Module.
2. Historical Defect Knowledge Base and RAG Pipeline Module.
3. Multi-Agent Orchestration and Analysis Pipeline.
4. Duplicate Detection and Similarity Matching Module.
5. Structured Findings and Resolution Display Module.
6. Defect Pattern Analytics and Systemic Issue Detection Module.

---

## 3.1 Bug Submission Module

The Bug Submission Module is the entry point of the system.

It allows a user or developer to submit a software defect through:

* Direct text input.
* Bug report text.
* Stack trace.
* Error logs.
* Uploaded files.

The purpose of this module is to provide a flexible interface because bug reports are not always available in one standard format.

For example, a developer may have a simple error message such as:

```text
KeyError: 'user_id'
```

Another developer may have a complete stack trace.

Another report may contain several hundred lines of application logs.

The system accepts these different forms of input and passes the information to the backend analysis pipeline.

---

## 3.2 Backend

The backend is implemented using **FastAPI**.

The backend provides the `/analyze` endpoint, which receives the submitted bug information and coordinates the analysis process.

The backend acts as the communication layer between:

* Frontend.
* AI agents.
* Retrieval system.
* Vector database.
* Analytics components.

The backend also helps separate the user interface from the actual analysis logic.

---

## 3.3 AI Agent Layer

The system uses multiple specialized agents.

The agents are:

### Triage Agent

Responsible for:

* Severity classification.
* Priority classification.
* Component identification.
* Confidence scoring.
* Classification reasoning.

### Log Analysis Agent

Responsible for:

* Exception identification.
* Error message analysis.
* Stack trace analysis.
* Failure point identification.
* Code path identification.

### Root Cause Agent

Responsible for:

* Probable root cause identification.
* Evidence analysis.
* Combining current bug information with historical knowledge.

### Duplicate Detection Agent

Responsible for:

* Searching similar historical bugs.
* Calculating semantic similarity.
* Identifying potential duplicate defects.

### Remediation Agent

Responsible for:

* Generating fix recommendations.
* Using historical resolutions.
* Connecting root cause findings with possible corrective actions.

---

## 3.4 Retrieval Layer

The retrieval layer implements the historical defect knowledge system.

The system uses **Sentence Transformer embeddings** to convert historical bug information into numerical vector representations.

These vectors are stored in **ChromaDB**.

When a new bug is submitted, an embedding is generated for the new bug and compared with historical vectors.

The most relevant historical defects are retrieved and provided as context to the downstream AI agents.

This is the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach used by the platform.

---

## 3.5 Analytics Layer

The analytics layer analyzes previously submitted and verified defects.

It provides information about:

* Severity distribution.
* Component frequency.
* Root cause frequency.
* Bug categories.
* Monthly defect trends.
* Recurring component/root-cause combinations.
* Potential systemic issues.

This allows the system to move from analyzing individual bugs to understanding broader software quality problems.

---

# 4. Technology Stack

The project uses the following technologies:

### Programming Language

**Python** is used as the primary programming language because of its extensive support for AI, machine learning, natural language processing, APIs, data processing, and vector databases.

### Frontend

**Streamlit** is used to develop the interactive user interface.

### Backend

**FastAPI** is used to create the backend service and expose the `/analyze` API endpoint.

### AI/LLM Layer

A Large Language Model is used by the specialized agents to perform natural language reasoning and generate structured diagnostic findings.

### Embedding Model

**Sentence Transformers** are used to generate semantic vector representations of bug reports and historical defects.

### Vector Database

**ChromaDB** is used to store and retrieve historical bug embeddings.

### Retrieval

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is used to provide historical defect information to the AI agents.

### Data Processing

Python-based processing and libraries such as Pandas are used for dataset preparation and analytics.

### Version Control

Git and GitHub are used for source-code management and project collaboration.

# Milestone 1

# 5. Milestone 1 — Research, System Design and Initial Implementation

**Duration: 30 June – 9 July**

## 5.1 Milestone Objective

The main objective of Milestone 1 was to establish the technical and architectural foundation of the Intelligent Bug Diagnosis Platform.

This milestone included both research and implementation.

The purpose was not only to understand how an intelligent defect diagnosis platform could be designed, but also to develop an initial working foundation that could be extended in later milestones.

The major activities were:

1. Study defect analysis workflows.
2. Study RAG architecture.
3. Study semantic similarity techniques.
4. Study bug report structures.
5. Design the overall system architecture.
6. Define responsibilities for each AI agent.

10. Collect historical defect datasets.
11. Preprocess historical bug data.
12. Generate embeddings.
13. Build the initial ChromaDB vector store.
14. Implement the initial RAG retrieval pipeline.

---

# 6. Research and Understanding

## 6.1 Study of Defect Analysis Workflows

The first stage involved understanding how software defects are normally processed by development teams.

A typical defect analysis workflow includes:

Bug Report

↓

Initial Triage

↓

Log and Stack Trace Analysis

↓

Root Cause Investigation

↓

Historical Bug Search

↓

Duplicate Identification

↓

Fix Development

↓

Verification

↓

Bug Resolution

The project architecture was designed around this workflow.

The goal was to automate as many repetitive activities as possible while still keeping human developers involved in final verification.

---

## 6.2 Study of Bug Report Structures

Bug reports can have different levels of detail.

A simple bug report may contain only:

```text
Application crashes when user logs in.
```

A more detailed report may contain:

```text
Application crashes during login.

Error:
NullPointerException

Stack trace:
...
```

A production bug report may contain:

* Application logs.
* Server logs.
* Error messages.
* Stack traces.
* Environment information.
* Component information.
* Reproduction steps.
* Expected behavior.
* Actual behavior.

The system therefore needed to support flexible bug inputs.

---

## 6.3 Study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation was studied as a method for providing external knowledge to AI agents.

A traditional language model may generate a response based on its learned knowledge, but it may not know the organization's previous bug reports or historical resolutions.

RAG addresses this problem by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and providing it to the model as context.

The proposed workflow is:

New Bug

↓

Embedding Generation

↓

Vector Search

↓

Historical Bug Retrieval

↓

Relevant Historical Context

↓

AI Analysis

This allows the system to use historical software engineering knowledge while analyzing new defects.

---

## 6.4 Study of Semantic Similarity

Semantic similarity techniques were studied because exact keyword matching is insufficient for bug detection.

For example, two reports may describe the same underlying issue using different wording:

```text
Database connection could not be established.
```

and:

```text
Application fails because the DB connection is unavailable.
```

Although the words are different, their meanings are similar.

Sentence Transformer embeddings allow these reports to be represented as vectors so that semantic similarity can be measured.

This technique became the foundation for the duplicate detection and historical retrieval modules.

---

# 7. System Architecture Design

The initial architecture was designed as follows:

User

↓

Streamlit Frontend

↓

FastAPI Backend

↓

Bug Preprocessing

↓

AI Analysis Pipeline

↓

Historical Knowledge Retrieval

↓

Structured Findings

↓

Streamlit Display

The AI analysis pipeline was designed around specialized agents.

The agent flow is:

Triage Agent

↓

Log Analysis Agent

↓

Root Cause Agent

↓

Duplicate Detection Agent

↓

Remediation Agent

Each agent has a specific responsibility.

---

# 8. Agent Responsibility Design

## 8.1 Triage Agent

The Triage Agent determines the importance and urgency of a bug.

It is responsible for:

* Severity.
* Priority.
* Component.
* Confidence.
* Reasoning.

---

## 8.2 Log Analysis Agent

The Log Analysis Agent focuses specifically on technical evidence.

It analyzes:

* Exceptions.
* Stack traces.
* Logs.
* Error messages.
* Failure locations.
* Code paths.

---

## 8.3 Root Cause Agent

The Root Cause Agent uses information from earlier agents and historical defects to determine the probable underlying cause.

---

## 8.4 Duplicate Detection Agent

The Duplicate Detection Agent uses semantic similarity to find existing defects that may represent the same or a related issue.

---

## 8.5 Remediation Agent

The Remediation Agent uses root cause information and historical resolutions to recommend possible fixes.

---

# 9. Bug Submission Module

An initial working version of the Bug Submission Module was implemented during Milestone 1.

The module supports:

* Direct bug description input.
* Stack trace input.
* Error log input.
* File upload.
* Combined bug information.

The Streamlit interface allows developers to submit a bug without needing to interact directly with the backend.

The submission is then passed to the FastAPI backend.

The backend prepares the information for analysis.

This module establishes the entry point for all subsequent milestones.

---

# 10. Historical Defect Knowledge Base

A major component of Milestone 1 was the creation of the historical defect knowledge base.

Public defect datasets were collected from sources including:

* Mozilla.
* Apache.
* Eclipse.

These datasets contain historical bug information that can be used as a source of engineering knowledge.

The purpose of using historical defects is to allow the system to answer questions such as:

* Has a similar bug occurred before?
* What component was affected?
* What was the probable cause?
* How was the previous issue resolved?
* Could the current bug be a duplicate?

---

# 11. Historical Data Processing

The collected historical data cannot be directly inserted into the vector database.

The data first needs to be prepared.

The preprocessing workflow includes:

Historical Dataset

↓

Data Cleaning

↓

Remove Irrelevant Information

↓

Normalize Text

↓

Extract Useful Bug Information

↓

Chunking

↓

Embedding Generation

↓

Vector Storage

The preprocessing step improves the quality of retrieval.

---

# 12. Embedding Generation

Sentence Transformer models are used to generate embeddings.

An embedding represents the semantic meaning of a bug report as a numerical vector.

For example:

```text
"Database connection failed"
```

is converted into a vector representation.

Historical bug reports are also converted into vectors.

When a new bug is submitted, its embedding is compared against the stored historical vectors.

The closest results are retrieved.

---

# 13. ChromaDB Vector Store

ChromaDB is used as the vector database.

The vector database stores:

* Bug embeddings.
* Bug descriptions.
* Historical metadata.
* Relevant defect information.

When a new bug is submitted, the system performs a semantic search against the vector database.

The most relevant historical bugs are returned to the analysis pipeline.

---

# 14. Milestone 1 RAG Pipeline

The implemented RAG pipeline follows:

Historical Bug Dataset

↓

Preprocessing

↓

Chunking

↓

Sentence Transformer

↓

Embedding Generation

↓

ChromaDB

↓

Semantic Search

↓

Historical Bug Retrieval

↓

AI Analysis

This pipeline forms the knowledge foundation for the remaining milestones.

---

# Milestone 2

# 16. Milestone 2 — Triage, Log Analysis and Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Duration: 10 July – 21 July**

## 16.1 Milestone Objective

Milestone 2 focused on converting the foundation created in Milestone 1 into an intelligent analysis pipeline.

The main objectives were:

1. Build the Triage Agent.
2. Build the Log Analysis Agent.
3. Implement multi-agent orchestration.
4. Pass agent outputs as context to downstream agents.
5. Produce structured outputs.
6. Validate the agents against different bug reports and error types.

---

# 17. Triage Agent

The Triage Agent was implemented as the first intelligent analysis component.

Its purpose is to perform the initial classification of a submitted bug.

The agent determines:

* Severity.
* Priority.
* Affected component.
* Confidence score.
* Reasoning.

---

## 17.1 Severity Classification

The system supports four major severity levels:

### Critical

A critical bug may:

* Cause complete application failure.
* Cause major service disruption.
* Result in significant data loss.
* Prevent essential functionality from working.

### High

A high-severity bug may significantly affect an important application feature but does not necessarily bring down the entire system.

### Medium

A medium-severity bug affects functionality but generally has a workaround or limited impact.

### Low

A low-severity bug generally has limited impact, such as minor UI issues or non-critical behavior.

---

# 18. Priority Classification

The Triage Agent also assigns priority.

Priority represents how urgently the development team should address the bug.

The system uses the information available in the bug report to determine the likely urgency.

The agent considers factors such as:

* User impact.
* System impact.
* Functionality affected.
* Frequency of occurrence.
* Business importance.
* Production impact.

---

# 19. Component Identification

The Triage Agent identifies the software component most likely associated with the bug.

Possible components may include:

* Database.
* Authentication.
* Networking.
* API.
* User Interface.
* File System.
* Memory Management.
* Backend Service.

Component identification is useful because it helps developers immediately identify the likely area of the application that requires investigation.

---

# 20. Confidence Scoring

The Triage Agent provides a confidence score with its classification.

For example:

```text
Severity: High
Priority: P1
Component: Database
Confidence: 0.89
```

The confidence score provides an indication of how strongly the available evidence supports the classification.

It is not treated as an absolute probability.

---

# 21. Triage Reasoning

The agent also provides reasoning behind the classification.

For example, if a database failure prevents users from accessing the application, the agent may classify the issue as High or Critical because the affected functionality is essential.

The reasoning makes the AI output easier for developers to understand and review.

---

# 22. Log Analysis Agent

The second major component implemented in Milestone 2 was the Log Analysis Agent.

The purpose of this agent is to extract useful technical information from logs and stack traces.

It analyzes:

* Exception types.
* Error messages.
* Stack traces.
* Failure points.
* Affected code paths.
* Relevant log information.

---

# 23. Exception Identification

The Log Analysis Agent identifies the exception associated with a failure.

Examples include:

```text
NullPointerException
```

```text
KeyError
```

```text
SQLException
```

```text
SocketTimeoutException
```

```text
OutOfMemoryError
```

Identifying the exception provides the downstream agents with a structured representation of the technical failure.

---

# 24. Failure Point Identification

The agent attempts to identify where the failure occurred.

For example, a stack trace may contain multiple function calls.

The agent examines the stack trace and identifies the function or operation most closely associated with the failure.

This information is useful for root cause analysis.

---

# 25. Affected Code Path

The Log Analysis Agent also attempts to determine the affected code path.

For example:

```text
API Request
    ↓
Authentication
    ↓
Database Query
    ↓
Database Connection Failure
```

This provides context about how the error propagated through the application.

---

# 26. Multi-Agent Orchestration

After implementing the two agents, they were connected through the orchestration layer.

The workflow became:

Bug Submission

↓

Triage Agent

↓

Log Analysis Agent

↓

Combined Context

↓

Downstream Agents

The Triage Agent provides classification information.

The Log Analysis Agent provides technical failure information.

These outputs are combined and passed to subsequent agents.

This approach avoids requiring every agent to independently process the entire raw bug report.

---

# 27. Structured Agent Output

The agents were designed to produce structured information.

An example of the combined output is:

```json
{
  "severity": "High",
  "priority": "P1",
  "component": "Database",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "exception_type": "SQLException",
  "failure_point": "Database connection initialization",
  "affected_code_path": "Login -> Authentication -> Database"
}
```

Structured output is important because later agents can directly consume these fields.

It also allows the frontend to display the information in separate sections.

---

# 28. Milestone 2 Validation

The Triage and Log Analysis agents were validated using different types of software defects.

The selected test cases included:

### NullPointerException

Used to test exception detection and failure analysis for null object access.

### Database/SQL Failure

Used to test database-related component identification and SQL error analysis.

### Python KeyError

Used to test Python-specific exception analysis.

### Socket Timeout

Used to test network-related failure analysis.

### OutOfMemoryError

Used to test severe memory-related failures.

The agents were also tested against different report formats and different levels of information completeness.

---

# 29. Milestone 2 Deliverables

The completed deliverables were:

* Triage Agent.
* Severity classification.
* Priority classification.
* Component classification.
* Confidence scoring.
* Triage reasoning.
* Log Analysis Agent.
* Exception detection.
* Error message analysis.
* Failure point identification.
* Affected code path identification.
* Multi-agent orchestration.
* Structured outputs.
* Agent validation.

---

# Milestone 3

# 30. Milestone 3 — Root Cause Analysis, Duplicate Detection and Remediation

## 30.1 Milestone Objective

Milestone 3 focused on extending the system beyond initial triage and log analysis.

The main objective was to allow the platform to answer deeper questions:

* What is probably causing this bug?
* Has a similar bug already been reported?
* Is this bug potentially a duplicate?
* Has a similar issue already been fixed?
* What fix could be applied to the current bug?

The following modules were implemented:

* Root Cause Agent.
* Duplicate Detection Agent.
* Remediation Agent.
* Structured Findings Display.

---

# 31. Root Cause Agent

The Root Cause Agent uses information from multiple sources.

These include:

* Bug description.
* Triage output.
* Log Analysis output.
* Stack trace.
* Error message.
* Affected component.
* Retrieved historical bugs.
* Historical resolutions.

The agent combines these sources to generate a probable root cause.

---

## 31.1 Root Cause Reasoning

The agent does not simply look at the error message.

It considers the complete context.

For example, an SQL error might initially indicate a database problem.

However, historical information may reveal that similar errors were caused by:

* Invalid connection configuration.
* Connection pool exhaustion.
* Incorrect database credentials.
* Database server unavailability.
* Query timeout.

Therefore, historical retrieval helps the Root Cause Agent distinguish between possible causes.

---

# 32. Root Cause Confidence

The agent provides a confidence score for its root cause hypothesis.

The confidence indicates how strongly the available evidence supports the proposed explanation.

The root cause is not treated as a guaranteed fact.

It is presented as a hypothesis that should be reviewed by developers.

---

# 33. Duplicate Detection Agent

The Duplicate Detection Agent searches the historical defect knowledge base for similar bugs.

The process is:

New Bug

↓

Embedding Generation

↓

Vector Search

↓

Similar Historical Bugs

↓

Similarity Analysis

↓

Potential Duplicate

The semantic similarity approach allows the system to detect bugs that may have similar meanings even when the wording is different.

---

# 34. Similarity Matching

The Duplicate Detection Agent uses the embeddings generated during the RAG pipeline.

Suppose the new bug says:

```text
Application fails because database connection is unavailable.
```

A historical bug may say:

```text
Service cannot establish connection with database server.
```

The wording is different, but the semantic meaning is similar.

The embedding-based retrieval system can identify the historical report as a relevant match.

---

# 35. Duplicate Detection Results

The system provides:

* Historical bug identifier.
* Historical bug description.
* Similarity score.
* Relevant matching information.
* Potential duplicate indication.

The similarity score is used as a retrieval indicator.

It should not be interpreted as an absolute probability that two bugs are duplicates.

Final duplicate classification should be verified by a developer.

---

# 36. Remediation Agent

The Remediation Agent is responsible for generating possible fixes.

It receives:

* Triage information.
* Log analysis.
* Root cause analysis.
* Historical bug matches.
* Historical resolutions.

The historical resolution information is particularly important because it allows the system to recommend fixes that have previously been used for similar defects.

---

# 37. Fix Recommendation Process

The remediation workflow is:

Current Bug

↓

Root Cause

↓

Historical Similar Bugs

↓

Historical Resolutions

↓

Remediation Analysis

↓

Recommended Fix

For example, if several historical bugs indicate that a particular connection configuration caused database failures and were successfully resolved by changing the configuration or implementing connection retry handling, the Remediation Agent can use this historical evidence when generating a recommendation.

---

# 38. Structured Findings Display

The Streamlit frontend was enhanced to display all results in an organized structure.

The user can view:

### Bug Triage

* Severity.
* Priority.
* Component.
* Confidence.
* Reasoning.

### Log Analysis

* Exception type.
* Error message.
* Failure point.
* Affected code path.

### Root Cause

* Probable root cause.
* Supporting information.
* Confidence.

### Duplicate Detection

* Similar historical bugs.
* Similarity scores.
* Potential duplicate status.

### Remediation

* Recommended fix.
* Historical resolution.
* Knowledge base evidence.

This makes the system easier for developers to use because the information is separated according to the type of analysis.

---

# 39. Milestone 3 Deliverables

# Milestone 4

# 40. Milestone 4 — Defect Analytics, Knowledge Base Growth and End-to-End Testing

## 40.1 Milestone Objective

Milestone 4 focused on completing the platform and extending its functionality beyond individual bug diagnosis.

The main objectives were:

* Analyze historical defect patterns.
* Identify recurring issues.
* Detect systemic problems.
* Create a feedback mechanism for knowledge base growth.
* Perform complete end-to-end testing.
* Validate the complete bug diagnosis workflow.

---

# 41. Defect Pattern Analytics

The defect analytics module analyzes previously submitted bugs.

Instead of looking at each bug independently, it identifies patterns across multiple defects.

The dashboard identifies:

* Severity distribution.
* Frequently affected components.
* Recurring root causes.
* Bug categories.
* Monthly defect trends.
* Systemic component/root-cause combinations.

---

# 42. Severity Distribution

The analytics module analyzes how bugs are distributed across severity levels.

For example:

```text
Critical
High
Medium
Low
```

This provides an overall view of the severity profile of the software system.

If a large percentage of defects are classified as High or Critical, this may indicate quality or stability concerns that require further investigation.

---

# 43. Frequently Affected Components

The analytics module identifies components that appear frequently in defect reports.

For example:

```text
Database        ███████████
Authentication ████████
Networking      ██████
API             █████
UI              ███
```

This helps development teams identify components that may require additional testing, refactoring, or architectural improvements.

---

# 44. Recurring Root Causes

The system also analyzes root cause information.

If the same root cause appears across multiple bugs, the system can identify it as a recurring defect pattern.

For example:

```text
Connection Pool Exhaustion
        ↓
Bug 101
Bug 118
Bug 134
Bug 159
```

This suggests that the issue may not be an isolated defect.

Instead, it may indicate a deeper architectural or configuration problem.

---

# 45. Bug Categories

The analytics system groups bugs into categories based on their characteristics.

Possible categories include:

* Database failures.
* Network failures.
* Memory failures.
* Runtime exceptions.
* Authentication failures.
* API failures.
* Data processing failures.

This provides an overview of the types of defects occurring in the system.

---

# 46. Monthly Defect Trends

The analytics module tracks defects over time.

Monthly trends help answer questions such as:

* Are defects increasing?
* Are defects decreasing?
* Which months had the highest number of defects?
* Did a particular development period introduce more problems?
* Are certain categories becoming more frequent?

This information can support software quality monitoring.

---

# 47. Systemic Component/Root-Cause Detection

The analytics module combines component information with root cause information.

For example:

```text
Database
   +
Connection Failure
   ↓
Recurring Systemic Problem
```

If the same component and root cause combination appears repeatedly, it may indicate a systemic issue.

This allows the platform to provide insights beyond individual bug fixing.

---

# 48. Knowledge Base Growth

A major feature implemented during Milestone 4 is the ability to continuously improve the historical knowledge base.

After a bug has been analyzed, the recommended fix can be reviewed by a human developer.

If the fix is verified and the bug is successfully resolved, the resolved bug can be added to the vector database.

The feedback loop is:

Bug Analysis

↓

Fix Recommendation

↓

Human Verification

↓

Resolved Bug

↓

Vector Database

↓

Future Retrieval

↓

Better Recommendations

This means the knowledge base does not remain static.

Instead, it grows as the organization resolves more defects.

---

# 49. Human Verification

Human verification is an important part of the knowledge base growth process.

AI-generated root causes and recommendations are not automatically considered correct.

A developer should verify:

* Whether the root cause is correct.
* Whether the recommended fix is valid.
* Whether the fix successfully resolves the issue.
* Whether the historical bug information is useful for future retrieval.

Only verified information should be added to the trusted knowledge base.

This helps prevent incorrect AI-generated information from contaminating future retrieval results.

---

# 50. End-to-End Testing

The complete system was tested using five different bug submissions.

The five test cases represent different categories of software failures:

### 1. NullPointerException

Tests runtime exception analysis and null reference failure diagnosis.

### 2. Database/SQL Failure

Tests database component detection, SQL error analysis, historical database retrieval, and remediation recommendations.

### 3. Python KeyError

Tests Python exception analysis and data-access-related failure diagnosis.

### 4. Socket Timeout

Tests network-related error analysis and timeout diagnosis.

### 5. OutOfMemoryError

Tests memory-related failure analysis and severity classification.

---

# 51. End-to-End Testing Workflow

Each bug submission passes through the complete system.

The workflow is:

Bug Submission

↓

Preprocessing

↓

Triage Agent

↓

Log Analysis Agent

↓

Historical Knowledge Retrieval

Root Cause Agent

↓

Duplicate Detection Agent

↓

Remediation Agent

↓

Structured Findings

↓

Human Review

The same workflow is used for all five test cases.

---

# 52. Test Case 1 — NullPointerException

The first test case uses a NullPointerException.

The purpose is to verify whether the system can:

* Identify the exception.
* Identify the failure point.
* Identify the affected component.
* Determine severity.
* Identify similar historical defects.
* Suggest a possible cause.
* Recommend a potential fix.

The test validates the system's handling of a common runtime exception.

---

# 53. Test Case 2 — Database/SQL Failure

The second test case represents a database or SQL-related failure.

The system is expected to:

* Identify the database component.
* Identify the SQL-related exception.
* Analyze the failure point.
* Retrieve similar database defects.
* Determine a probable root cause.
* Identify potential duplicate reports.
* Recommend a suitable remediation.

This test validates the historical retrieval capability because database failures are commonly represented in historical bug datasets.

---

# 54. Test Case 3 — Python KeyError

The third test case uses a Python KeyError.

The system analyzes:

* Exception type.
* Missing key information.
* Failure location.
* Affected code path.
* Component.
* Historical similar bugs.

This test demonstrates that the system can work with Python-specific runtime errors.

---

# 55. Test Case 4 — Socket Timeout

The fourth test case uses a socket timeout.

The system analyzes:

* Network-related failure.
* Timeout information.
* Affected component.
* Failure point.
* Historical network-related defects.

The Root Cause Agent can then use the available evidence to identify possible causes such as network availability, server responsiveness, or timeout configuration.

---

# 56. Test Case 5 — OutOfMemoryError

The fifth test case represents a memory-related failure.

This case is particularly useful for testing severity and priority classification because memory exhaustion can cause major application instability.

The system analyzes:

* Memory-related exception.
* Failure point.
* Affected component.
* Severity.
* Root cause.
* Historical similar defects.
* Possible remediation.

---

# 57. Overall Results

After completion of all milestones, the platform provides a complete bug diagnosis pipeline.

For each submitted bug, the user can view:

* Severity.
* Priority.
* Component.
* Triage confidence.
* Triage reasoning.
* Exception type.
* Error message.
* Failure point.
* Affected code path.
* Probable root cause.
* Root cause confidence.
* Similar historical bugs.
* Duplicate indicators.
* Similarity scores.
* Historical resolutions.
* Recommended fixes.
* Knowledge base matches.

The platform therefore combines multiple AI capabilities into a single workflow.

---

# 59. Benefits

The developed platform provides several benefits to software development teams.

## 59.1 Reduced Debugging Effort

The system automates repetitive initial debugging activities.

Developers do not need to manually inspect every historical defect before starting their investigation.

---

## 59.2 Faster Bug Triage

The Triage Agent immediately provides severity, priority, and component information.

This helps teams determine which bugs require immediate attention.

---

## 59.3 Automated Log Analysis

The Log Analysis Agent extracts useful information from stack traces and error logs.

This reduces the time developers spend manually reading long logs.

---

## 59.4 Historical Knowledge Reuse

The RAG pipeline allows the system to reuse previously resolved defect information.

This prevents useful debugging knowledge from being lost.

---

## 59.5 Duplicate Detection

The Duplicate Detection Agent helps identify bugs that may already exist in the defect database.

This can prevent multiple developers from independently investigating the same underlying issue.

---

## 59.6 Root Cause Assistance

The Root Cause Agent provides probable explanations based on current evidence and historical defects.

This helps developers focus their investigation.

---

## 59.7 Fix Recommendation

The Remediation Agent uses historical resolutions to generate actionable recommendations.

This can reduce the time required to identify possible solutions.

---

## 59.8 Recurring Issue Detection

Analytics can identify recurring root causes and frequently affected components.

This allows teams to investigate larger engineering problems instead of repeatedly fixing individual symptoms.

---

## 59.9 Continuous Knowledge Improvement

Verified resolved bugs can be added to the knowledge base.

As the database grows, the retrieval system has access to more historical engineering knowledge.

---

# 60. Limitations

The platform also has several limitations.

## 60.1 Dependence on Historical Data

The quality of retrieval and fix recommendations depends on the quality of historical defect information.

If historical bugs are incomplete or poorly documented, the recommendations may be less useful.

---

## 60.2 Root Cause Predictions Are Hypotheses

The Root Cause Agent provides a probable cause rather than a guaranteed diagnosis.

Developers must verify the proposed root cause before making changes to production systems.

---

## 60.3 Similarity Scores Are Not Absolute Duplicate Probabilities

A high similarity score indicates that two bug reports are semantically similar.

It does not guarantee that the bugs have exactly the same root cause.

Human verification is therefore required.

---

## 60.4 Incomplete Bug Reports

If a bug report does not contain enough information, the system may not have sufficient evidence for accurate analysis.

For example, missing stack traces or logs can reduce the quality of root cause analysis.

---

## 60.5 AI Model Limitations

The quality of the analysis depends on the underlying language model.

AI-generated reasoning may occasionally be incomplete or incorrect.

Therefore, the system is designed as a developer-assistance platform rather than a fully autonomous debugging system.

---

# 61. Future Work

Several improvements can be implemented in future versions.

## 61.1 Human Feedback Learning

Future versions can collect developer feedback about:

* Correctness of triage.
* Correctness of root cause.
* Quality of duplicate matches.
* Usefulness of recommendations.

This feedback can be used to improve the system.

---

## 61.2 Better Duplicate Classification

The current similarity system identifies potentially similar bugs.

Future versions can introduce a dedicated duplicate classification model that distinguishes between:

* Exact duplicates.
* Related bugs.
* Same component but different causes.
* Unrelated bugs.

---

## 61.3 Code-Aware Embeddings

Future versions can use code-aware embedding models.

This would allow the system to consider source-code structure in addition to natural-language bug descriptions.

This could improve:

* Root cause analysis.
* Duplicate detection.
* Code path identification.
* Fix recommendations.

---

## 61.4 Jira Integration

The platform can be integrated with Jira so that bug reports can be automatically imported and analysis results can be attached to tickets.

---

## 61.5 GitHub Integration

Future versions can integrate with GitHub Issues and repositories.

This could allow the system to connect:

Bug Report

↓

Historical Issue

↓

Source Code

↓

Commit

↓

Fix

This would significantly improve remediation assistance.

---

## 61.6 Automatic Fix Validation

Future versions could automatically validate recommended fixes by running tests.

The workflow could become:

Recommended Fix

↓

Code Change

↓

Automated Tests

↓

Regression Testing

↓

Fix Validation

This would provide stronger evidence that the recommendation actually resolves the problem.

---

## 61.7 Production Deployment

The prototype can be extended into a production-ready application with:

* Scalable backend services.
* Authentication.
* Monitoring.
* Logging.
* Secure API access.
* Database management.
* Containerization.
* Cloud deployment.

---

## 61.8 Role-Based Access Control

Different users could have different permissions.

For example:

* Developer.
* Tester.
* Project Manager.
* Administrator.

Each role could access different features and datasets.

---

## 61.9 Monitoring and Audit Logging

Future versions can record:

* Who submitted a bug.
* Which analysis was performed.
* Which historical bugs were retrieved.
* What recommendation was generated.
* Who verified the recommendation.
* When the knowledge base was updated.

This would make the platform more suitable for enterprise environments.

# 65. Conclusion

The **Intelligent Bug Diagnosis Platform with Fix Recommendation Assistance** demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence, multi-agent systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, semantic similarity, and historical software defect knowledge can be combined to assist developers in software debugging.

The project was developed progressively through four milestones.

During **Milestone 1**, the project foundation was established. The team studied software defect analysis workflows, RAG architecture, semantic similarity, and bug report structures. The system architecture and responsibilities of each AI agent were designed. A working Bug Submission Module was implemented, and an initial historical defect knowledge base was created using public Mozilla, Apache, and Eclipse datasets. The data was processed, embedded using Sentence Transformers, and indexed in ChromaDB to establish the RAG pipeline.

During **Milestone 2**, the platform was extended with intelligent triage and log analysis. The Triage Agent was implemented to classify severity, priority, affected components, confidence, and reasoning. The Log Analysis Agent was implemented to identify exception types, failure points, error information, and affected code paths. These agents were connected through a multi-agent orchestration pipeline and validated using different types of bug reports.

During **Milestone 3**, the platform moved from basic analysis to deeper diagnosis and remediation assistance. The Root Cause Agent was introduced to identify probable underlying causes using current bug evidence and historical knowledge. The Duplicate Detection Agent used semantic similarity to find potentially duplicate or related historical bugs. The Remediation Agent used historical resolutions and root cause information to generate possible fixes. Structured findings were added to the user interface to make the results easier for developers to understand.

During **Milestone 4**, the platform was extended with defect analytics and continuous knowledge improvement. The analytics module identifies severity distributions, frequently affected components, recurring root causes, bug categories, monthly trends, and systemic component/root-cause combinations. A knowledge base growth mechanism was also introduced in which verified resolved bugs can be added to the vector database for future retrieval. Finally, the complete system was tested using five representative bug types: NullPointerException, Database/SQL failure, Python KeyError, Socket timeout, and OutOfMemoryError.

The final platform provides a complete workflow:

**Bug Submission**

**Triage**

↓

**Log Analysis**

↓

**Historical Knowledge Retrieval**

↓

**Root Cause Analysis**

**Fix Recommendation**

↓

**Structured Findings**

↓

**Human Verification**

↓

**Knowledge Base Growth**

↓

**Future Retrieval and Improved Recommendations**

The system demonstrates that historical defect knowledge can be combined with specialized AI agents to reduce repetitive debugging activities and provide developers with useful diagnostic assistance.

The platform also goes beyond individual bug diagnosis by identifying recurring defect patterns and potential systemic issues. This provides an opportunity for development teams to use defect data not only for fixing individual problems but also for improving overall software quality.

Although the system still requires human verification and depends on the quality of historical data, it provides a strong foundation for an intelligent software engineering assistant.

The project can be further extended through code-aware embeddings, Jira and GitHub integration, automatic fix validation, human feedback learning, CI/CD integration, production deployment, and advanced defect analytics.

Overall, the completed project demonstrates the practical application of **multi-agent AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to software defect diagnosis, duplicate detection, root cause analysis, remediation recommendation, and continuous engineering knowledge improvement.**
