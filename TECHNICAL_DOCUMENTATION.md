# Creation of Intelligent Bug Diagnosis Platform with Fix Recommendation Assistance

## Group 1

# 1. Introduction

Software development teams receive large numbers of bug reports during the development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. These reports may contain error messages, stack traces, application logs, descriptions of unexpected behavior, reproduction steps, screenshots, and information about affected components.

In many development environments, the initial diagnosis of a bug is performed manually. Developers need to read the complete bug report, understand the error message, inspect stack traces, identify the affected component, search previously reported bugs, determine whether the issue is a duplicate, investigate the probable root cause, and finally search for a suitable solution.

This manual process can be time-consuming, especially for large software projects containing thousands of historical defect reports.

The **Intelligent Bug Diagnosis Platform with Fix Recommendation Assistance** is designed to automate and assist with these activities using Artificial Intelligence, multi-agent architecture, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic similarity, and historical defect knowledge.

The platform receives a new bug report and processes it through a sequence of specialized AI agents.

The complete pipeline consists of:

**Bug Submission**

↓

**Triage Agent**

↓

**Log Analysis Agent**

↓

**Historical Knowledge Retrieval**

↓

**Root Cause Agent**

↓

**Duplicate Detection Agent**

↓

**Remediation Agent**

↓

**Structured Findings**

↓

**Human Verification**

The system also contains an analytics layer that analyzes previously submitted defects and identifies recurring patterns, frequently affected components, recurring root causes, and possible systemic issues.

The project was implemented progressively through four milestones.

---

# 2. Project Objectives

The primary objective of the project is to develop an intelligent software defect diagnosis platform capable of assisting developers throughout the bug analysis process.

The specific objectives are:

* Automatically process submitted bug reports.
* Support direct text input and file uploads.
* Analyze stack traces and error logs.
* Classify bug severity.
* Assign bug priority.
* Identify affected software components.
* Provide confidence scores and reasoning.

---

# 3. Scope of the Project

The project covers the complete workflow from bug submission to diagnosis and remediation recommendation.

The major modules are:

1. Bug Submission Module.
2. Historical Defect Knowledge Base and RAG Pipeline.
3. Multi-Agent Orchestration and Analysis Pipeline.
4. Duplicate Detection and Similarity Matching.
5. Structured Findings and Resolution Display.
6. Defect Pattern Analytics and Systemic Issue Detection.
7. Knowledge Base Growth and Verification.

The platform is designed as a developer-assistance system. It does not replace human developers or automatically apply fixes to production systems.

The AI-generated root causes and remediation recommendations are treated as recommendations that should be verified by developers.

---

# 4. System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture.

The major components are:

### Frontend

Streamlit-based user interface.

---

# 5. Technology Stack

The following technologies are used in the project.

## 5.1 Python

Python is used as the primary programming language.

It provides libraries and frameworks required for:

* Artificial Intelligence.
* Natural Language Processing.
* Data processing.
* Embedding generation.
* API development.
* Vector database integration.
* Analytics.

---

## 5.2 Streamlit

Streamlit is used to build the frontend.

The interface allows users to:

* Enter bug descriptions.
* Paste stack traces.
* Paste error logs.
* Upload files.
* Start analysis.
* View agent outputs.
* View historical matches.
* View recommended fixes.
* View analytics.

---

## 5.3 FastAPI

FastAPI is used for the backend service.

The `/analyze` endpoint receives bug information from the frontend and starts the analysis pipeline.

The backend manages communication between the frontend, agents, retrieval system, and database.

---

## 5.4 Large Language Model

A Large Language Model is used to perform intelligent analysis through specialized agents.

The model is used for:

* Bug classification.
* Log interpretation.
* Root cause reasoning.
* Duplicate reasoning.
* Fix recommendation.

---

## 5.5 Sentence Transformers

Sentence Transformer embeddings are used to represent bug reports as numerical vectors.

This enables semantic similarity rather than simple keyword matching.

---

## 5.6 ChromaDB

ChromaDB is used as the vector database.

It stores:

* Bug embeddings.
* Historical defect descriptions.
* Metadata.
* Historical resolutions.

The database allows relevant historical bugs to be retrieved when a new defect is submitted.

---

## 5.7 RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is used to combine AI reasoning with historical software defect knowledge.

The general process is:

**New Bug**

↓

**Embedding**

↓

**Vector Search**

↓

**Historical Bugs**

↓

**Context**

↓

**AI Agent**

↓

**Analysis**

---

## 5.8 Git and GitHub

Git is used for version control and GitHub is used for project source-code management and collaboration.

**GitHub Repository:**

---

# 6. System Modules

## 6.1 Bug Submission Module

The Bug Submission Module is the entry point of the application.

Users can provide:

* Bug title.
* Bug description.
* Stack trace.
* Error logs.
* Additional technical information.
* Uploaded bug files.

The system combines the available information into a format that can be processed by the backend.

The module supports both direct text submission and file upload.

---

# 7. Historical Defect Knowledge Base

The Historical Defect Knowledge Base contains previously reported software defects.

Public defect datasets from sources such as:

* Mozilla.
* Apache.
* Eclipse.

were used as the initial source of historical defect information.

The historical data provides examples of:

* Bug descriptions.
* Error information.
* Components.
* Defect categories.
* Previous resolutions.

The knowledge base is important because the system can compare a newly submitted bug with defects that have already occurred.

---

# 8. Historical Data Processing

The historical datasets are first cleaned and prepared.

The processing pipeline is:

**Historical Dataset**

↓

**Data Cleaning**

↓

**Normalization**

↓

**Relevant Information Extraction**

↓

**Chunking**

↓

**Embedding Generation**

↓

**ChromaDB**

The preprocessing step removes unnecessary information and prepares the bug reports for semantic retrieval.

---

# 9. Embedding and Semantic Retrieval

Each historical bug is converted into a semantic vector using a Sentence Transformer model.

A new bug is also converted into an embedding.

The system then performs vector similarity search.

For example, the following two reports may use different words:

> "Unable to connect to database server."

and

> "Application cannot establish a DB connection."

Keyword matching may not identify them as strongly related.

Semantic embeddings allow the system to identify their similar meaning.

The retrieved bugs are then passed as historical context to the downstream agents.

---

# 10. Multi-Agent Architecture

The platform uses specialized agents instead of asking one AI component to perform every task.

The agents are:

1. Triage Agent.
2. Log Analysis Agent.
3. Root Cause Agent.
4. Duplicate Detection Agent.
5. Remediation Agent.

Each agent performs a specific task.

---

# 11. Triage Agent

The Triage Agent performs the initial classification of the bug.

It determines:

* Severity.
* Priority.
* Affected component.
* Confidence score.
* Reasoning.

### Severity Levels

The system uses:

* Critical.
* High.
* Medium.
* Low.

### Example

A complete application crash caused by memory exhaustion may be classified as:

```text
Severity: Critical
Priority: P1
Component: Memory Management
Confidence: 0.94
```

The confidence score indicates the strength of the evidence supporting the classification.

---

# 12. Log Analysis Agent

The Log Analysis Agent examines technical evidence.

It analyzes:

* Error messages.
* Stack traces.
* Application logs.
* Exception types.
* Failure points.
* Affected code paths.

The agent converts unstructured logs into structured information that can be consumed by the downstream agents.

Example:

```text
Exception Type:
NullPointerException

Failure Point:
UserService.getUser()

Affected Code Path:
Login → UserService → Database Lookup
```

---

# 13. Root Cause Agent

The Root Cause Agent receives the outputs of the previous stages.

It considers:

* Original bug report.
* Triage findings.
* Log analysis.
* Historical bug matches.
* Affected component.
* Error information.

The agent then generates a probable root cause.

The root cause is treated as a hypothesis rather than a guaranteed fact.

---

# 14. Duplicate Detection Agent

The Duplicate Detection Agent uses semantic similarity to compare the current bug against historical bugs.

The process is:

**Current Bug**

↓

**Embedding Generation**

↓

**Vector Search**

↓

**Top Historical Matches**

↓

**Similarity Analysis**

↓

**Potential Duplicate**

The output contains historical matches and similarity scores.

Similarity scores are retrieval indicators and should not be interpreted as absolute duplicate probabilities.

---

# 15. Remediation Agent

The Remediation Agent generates possible solutions.

It uses:

* Current bug details.
* Log analysis.
* Root cause findings.
* Historical similar bugs.
* Historical resolutions.

The workflow is:

**Bug**

↓

**Root Cause**

↓

**Historical Match**

↓

**Historical Resolution**

↓

**Fix Recommendation**

The objective is to provide practical suggestions that developers can investigate and validate.

---

# 16. Multi-Agent Orchestration

The agents are connected through an orchestration pipeline.

The complete flow is:

```text
Bug Submission
      |
      v
Triage Agent
      |
      v
Log Analysis Agent
      |
      v
Historical Retrieval
      |
      v
Root Cause Agent
      |
      v
Duplicate Detection Agent
      |
      v
Remediation Agent
      |
      v
Structured Findings
```

The output of one stage becomes contextual information for the next stage.

This reduces duplication of analysis and allows each agent to specialize in a specific task.

---

# 17. Structured Findings

The final results are presented in structured sections.

The user can view:

### Triage

* Severity.
* Priority.
* Component.
* Confidence.
* Reasoning.

### Log Analysis

* Exception type.
* Error message.
* Failure point.
* Affected code path.

### Root Cause

* Probable root cause.

* Confidence.
* Reasoning.

The agent provides the first structured interpretation of the submitted bug.

---

## 19.3 Log Analysis Implementation

The Log Analysis Agent identifies:

* Exception type.
* Failure point.
* Error message.
* Affected code path.

This transforms raw technical information into structured diagnostic information.

---

## 19.4 Multi-Agent Integration

The two agents were connected.

The workflow became:

```text
Bug Submission
      ↓
Triage Agent
      ↓
Log Analysis Agent
      ↓
Combined Context
```

This combined context is used by the downstream agents implemented in Milestone 3.

---

## 19.5 Milestone 2 Validation

The system was tested using:

1. NullPointerException.
2. Database/SQL failure.
3. Python KeyError.
4. Socket timeout.
5. OutOfMemoryError.

These cases were selected because they represent different categories of software failures.

---

# 20. Milestone 3 — Root Cause, Duplicate Detection and Remediation

Milestone 3 expanded the platform from basic bug classification to deeper diagnosis.

The following components were implemented:

* Root Cause Agent.
* Duplicate Detection Agent.
* Remediation Agent.
* Structured Findings Display.

---

## 20.1 Root Cause Analysis

The Root Cause Agent combines the current bug information with historical evidence.

It identifies a probable underlying cause.

For example, a database error may have several possible causes.

Historical defects can help identify whether similar issues were caused by:

* Invalid configuration.
* Database availability.
* Connection pool exhaustion.
* Authentication problems.
* Query timeout.

---

## 20.2 Duplicate Detection

The Duplicate Detection Agent searches the historical database for semantically similar defects.

The retrieved historical bugs are presented with similarity scores.

The developer can then determine whether the current issue is an actual duplicate.

---

## 20.3 Remediation Recommendation

The Remediation Agent uses historical resolutions to generate possible fixes.

This allows previously acquired engineering knowledge to be reused.

---

# 21. Milestone 4 — Analytics, Knowledge Growth and Testing

Milestone 4 completed the broader platform functionality.

The major features were:

* Defect Pattern Analytics.
* Systemic Issue Detection.
* Knowledge Base Growth.
* End-to-End Testing.

---

## 21.1 Defect Pattern Analytics

The analytics dashboard identifies:

* Severity distribution.
* Frequently affected components.
* Recurring root causes.
* Bug categories.
* Monthly defect trends.
* Component/root-cause combinations.

---

## 21.2 Knowledge Base Growth

A verified resolved bug can be added to the vector database.

The process is:

```text
Bug Analysis
     ↓
Fix Recommendation
     ↓
Human Verification
     ↓
Bug Resolution
     ↓
Verified Knowledge
     ↓
Vector Database
     ↓
Future Retrieval
```

This creates a feedback loop through which the platform can continuously improve its historical knowledge.

---

# 22. Final Demonstration

The final demonstration showcases a minimum of five distinct bug submissions.

Each bug passes through the complete agent pipeline:

```text

```

The five demonstration bugs are:

1. NullPointerException.
2. Database/SQL Failure.
3. Python KeyError.
4. Socket Timeout.
5. OutOfMemoryError.

---

# 23. Demonstration 1 — NullPointerException

## 23.1 Bug Submission

The first demonstration uses a Java NullPointerException.

### Submitted Bug

```text

at com.example.profile.ProfileController.getProfile(ProfileController.java:42)
at com.example.api.UserController.profile(UserController.java:25)
```

---

## 23.2 Triage Agent Output

```text
Severity: High

Priority: P1

Affected Component:
User Profile / Backend Service

Confidence:
0.94

Reasoning:
The application crashes when a user attempts to access the
profile page after authentication. The failure affects an
important user-facing feature and results in an application
exception.
```

---

## 23.3 Log Analysis Agent Output

```text
Exception Type:
NullPointerException

Failure Point:
ProfileService.loadProfile()

Failure Line:
ProfileService.java:87

Affected Code Path:
UserController
    ↓
ProfileController
    ↓
ProfileService
    ↓
User.getName()

Technical Finding:
The user object is null when the profile service attempts
to access the user's name.
```

---

## 23.4 Historical Retrieval

The RAG system searches the historical defect database.

Example retrieved matches:

```text
Historical Bug 1:
User profile crashes when user record is unavailable.

returned from the user lookup operation. When the user record
is missing or the lookup returns null, the service directly
invokes getName() without performing a null check.

Confidence:
0.92
```

---

## 23.6 Duplicate Detection Output

```text
Potential Duplicate:

Historical Bug 1

# 28. Final Demonstration Summary

The five demonstrations cover different categories of software defects.

| Test Case | Bug Type             | Main Component         | Severity |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| 1         | NullPointerException | User Profile           | High     |
| 2         | Database/SQL Failure | Database               | Critical |

# 30. Defect Pattern Analytics Demonstration

After submitting multiple bugs, the analytics module can analyze the accumulated results.

For the five demonstration cases, the system can identify patterns such as:

### Severity Pattern

The demonstration set contains:

* 2 Critical bugs.
* 2 High bugs.
* 1 Medium bug.
* 0 Low bugs.

This demonstrates how the system can summarize the overall severity profile of submitted defects.

---

## 30.1 Component Pattern

The five bugs affect different areas:

* User Profile.
* Database.
* User API.
* Payment/Networking.
* File Processing/Memory.

This allows the analytics layer to identify which components appear most frequently as the dataset grows.

---

## 30.2 Root Cause Pattern

The demonstration produces several categories of root causes:

* Missing validation.
* Database connectivity/configuration.
* Missing request-field validation.
* External service latency.
* Excessive memory consumption.

If similar causes appear repeatedly in a larger dataset, the analytics module can identify them as recurring patterns.

---

## 30.3 Systemic Issue Detection

Suppose multiple future bugs contain:

```text
Component: Database
Root Cause: Connection Configuration
```

The analytics module can identify the combination as a potential systemic issue.

Similarly:

```text
Component: API
Root Cause: Missing Input Validation
```

appearing repeatedly may indicate that validation is not being consistently implemented across the application.

---

# 31. Knowledge Base Feedback Loop Demonstration

After the five bugs are resolved and verified by developers, their information can be added to the historical knowledge base.

For example:

```text
Bug:
OutOfMemoryError during large file processing

Root Cause:
Excessive in-memory file processing

Verified Fix:
Streaming/chunk-based processing

Status:
Resolved and verified
```

The verified information can then be embedded and stored in ChromaDB.

A future bug involving large-file memory exhaustion can retrieve this resolved defect.

The process becomes:

```text
New Bug
   ↓
Historical Search
   ↓
Similar Resolved Bug
   ↓
Root Cause Evidence
   ↓
Historical Fix
   ↓
Recommendation
```

This creates a continuously improving knowledge base.

# 34. Results

The completed platform demonstrates a complete AI-assisted defect diagnosis workflow.

The system is capable of receiving a bug report, performing initial triage, analyzing technical logs, retrieving historical defects, determining a probable root cause, detecting potentially duplicate defects, and generating remediation recommendations.

The final platform also provides analytics over accumulated defect information.

The five demonstration cases prove that the pipeline can process different categories of software failures:

* Runtime exceptions.
* Database failures.
* Python application errors.
* Network failures.
* Memory failures.

The system therefore provides a general-purpose foundation rather than a solution designed for only one type of software defect.

---

## Historical Data Quality

The quality of retrieval depends on the quality of historical bug reports.

## AI Reliability

AI-generated results can contain errors and should be reviewed.

## Root Cause Uncertainty

Root cause findings are hypotheses.

## Similarity Limitations

Semantic similarity does not guarantee that two bugs are duplicates.

## Incomplete Reports

Missing logs or stack traces can reduce diagnostic accuracy.

## Fix Validation

The system recommends fixes but does not automatically guarantee that a fix resolves the problem.

# 40. Final Conclusion

The **Intelligent Bug Diagnosis Platform with Fix Recommendation Assistance** demonstrates the practical use of Artificial Intelligence, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, semantic similarity, vector databases, and multi-agent systems for software defect diagnosis.

The project was implemented progressively across four milestones.

Milestone 1 established the foundation by researching defect analysis, RAG, semantic similarity, and bug report structures. The initial system architecture was designed, the Bug Submission Module was implemented, and a historical defect knowledge base was created using public defect datasets.

Milestone 2 introduced intelligent triage and log analysis. The Triage Agent classified severity, priority, and affected components, while the Log Analysis Agent extracted exception types, failure points, and affected code paths. These agents were connected through a multi-agent orchestration pipeline.

Milestone 3 expanded the platform with deeper diagnosis. The Root Cause Agent analyzed probable underlying causes, the Duplicate Detection Agent retrieved potentially related historical defects, and the Remediation Agent generated possible fixes using historical resolutions.

Milestone 4 completed the platform by introducing defect pattern analytics, systemic issue detection, knowledge base growth, and end-to-end testing.

The final demonstration validates the platform using five distinct bug submissions:

1. NullPointerException.
2. Database/SQL failure.
3. Python KeyError.
4. Socket timeout.
5. OutOfMemoryError.

Each bug is processed through the complete pipeline:

**Bug Submission**

↓

**Triage Agent**

↓

**Log Analysis Agent**

↓

**Historical Knowledge Retrieval**

↓

**Root Cause Agent**

↓

**Duplicate Detection Agent**

↓

**Remediation Agent**

↓

**Structured Findings**

**Human Verification**

The final system provides developers with a consolidated view of the bug's severity, priority, component, technical failure, probable root cause, historical similarities, duplicate indicators, and recommended remediation.

The addition of the analytics layer further allows the platform to identify recurring defects and systemic problems across multiple bug reports.

The knowledge base growth mechanism creates a feedback loop in which verified resolved defects become available for future retrieval. As more verified bugs are added, the system can potentially provide increasingly relevant historical context and recommendations.

The platform is therefore not limited to one-time bug classification. It provides a foundation for a continuously improving AI-assisted software engineering system.

Although human verification remains necessary and the quality of recommendations depends on the available historical data and AI model, the completed prototype demonstrates that multi-agent AI and RAG can significantly assist the software defect diagnosis workflow.

Overall, the project successfully integrates:

**Bug Submission + RAG + Semantic Retrieval + Multi-Agent AI + Root Cause Analysis + Duplicate Detection + Remediation Recommendation + Defect Analytics + Knowledge Base Growth**

into a single intelligent bug diagnosis platform.
